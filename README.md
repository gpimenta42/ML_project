# Claim Injury Type prediction 

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/to-grant-or-not-to-grant/data) 

## Preprocessing 
### Feature Engineering
### Data preparation  
- Missing data: Mean or outlier imputation 
- Outliers: Domain-specific  
### Categorical encoding 
Two encoders were used for non-target categorical features to capture complementary information:
- **Frequency Encoding**
- **Target Ordinal Encoding**: a variant of target encoding, where categories are assigned integer values based on the ordered mean of the target variable 
- **Ordinal Encoding**: for target
  
## Feature Selection 

- **Mean cross-correlation dropout**: drops features with high mean correlation with other features 
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: selects features that maximized validation F1-macro score with Random Forest Classifier

## SHAP Feature Importances

Most Important Features Influencing Claim Severity:
- Wage: Higher wages are generally associated with higher claim values.
- Days to First Hearing: A shorter time to the first hearing often correlates with more severe claims.
- Attorney Involvement: Claims involving attorneys tend to be of higher severity.
- IME-3 Count: A higher number of IME-3 evaluations is associated with increased claim severity.
- Missing C-3 Form: The absence of the C-3 form is often linked to fatal claims, as deceased individuals cannot complete the form.
- Part of Body Injured: Certain body parts are more commonly associated with fatal or severe injuries.
- Accidentâ€“Assembly Gap (Days): A long delay between the accident and the corresponding result in canceled claims.
